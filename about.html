<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Stellar is leading business jet aviation into the digital age. Powered by an all cloud infrastructure, we connect the business aviation industry on the ground and in the sky. Our integrated platform delivers the first real-time sourcing, pricing, booking, payment and analytics solutions to satisfy the world’s most demanding jet operators and air travelers.</p>
<h3>Why we are here</h3>
<p>Business aviation contributes $150B to US economic output and employs more than 1.2 million people. The same dysfunction exists in this industry as all other travel markets before the internet. A travel marketplace becomes exponentially more valuable than the sum of its parts when it can search, source, price and pay in real time.</p> 
<h3>Why we are Stellar</h3>
<p>At the core of our company is an intelligent set of PhD developed algorithms powering flight routing calculations, fleet optimization, adaptive flight and pricing rules, a high value payments platform, and predictive price analytics. When you eliminate friction in a dysfunctional market and make it liquid, transparent, and easy to access, wonderful new things happen. Stellar’s executive team has 30 years of experience living private aviation’s pain points and cost structure. We also have an equal amount of experience building successful e-commerce and logistics marketplaces.</p>
<p>Our team and advisors consist of MBA’s, PhD’s, and senior leaders from top schools such as MIT, Standford, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Wharton, and even Santa Clara. We come from all walks of life with diverse degrees in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electric Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Applied Micro Economics, Applied Mathematics, Aeronotics and Astronautics, Artificial Intelligence, Revenue Management, and Physics. We also have a decorated former Navy Seal on the team who’s quite simply a badass. Our team, assembled over the past two years, is highly qualified with a track record of successful start ups, exits and multi-billion dollar IPO’s.</p>
